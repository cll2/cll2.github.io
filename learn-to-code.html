  <h1>Learning to Code</h1>

      <h2>Learning to code amid the "Learn to Code" movement</h2>
      <p class="content">
            It was 2022, and I was in my second year of complacency in a remote job that I worked for a year
            to find in the pre-covid era, when interest rates began to shoot up and the rounds oflayoffs started. 
            After 7 exhausting years in front line health-care work, and after finally finding a way to support 
            myself (mostly) from a laptop, I had allowed myself to sit on my haunches. Perhaps I was basking in the 
            relief a little too long, or letting decision fatigue take hold, but along the line I had lost the motivation 
            I once had to start moving my career in a different direction. After surviving layoff round 1, when  
            round 2 came around with voluntary severence offers, I took it and ran, and considered it a sign to find and pick up 
            my motivation from wherever, whenever I had left it. Note, this separation wasn't a completely devistating force
            leading to despiration, as I still had my foot in the healthcare world; But I was still eager enough for change 
            that I fought fully falling back on it. Enter: "Learn to code." Around 2019, the 'learn to code' movement was 
            in it's peak memeification as middle class manufacturing, retail, and energy workers were met with this 
            flippant advice as their menas of making a living were shut down, automated, or off-shored without much care. Before 
            critical meme-mass, I had heard this term and was generally aware of some of the challenges faced in other 
            sectors, but by deliberately choosing healthcare as a way of insulating myself from job insecurity, it 
            left me less alert and out of touch with the state of the broader job market. So as I entered the 'learn 
            to code' pool, thinking 'I'm not like the others.' 'I'm doing this because I want to, not because I have 
            to,' I wasn't able to fully predict the headwind I was about to face. As it stood, I had for a while a growing interest in 
            learning how to harness technology, initially tinkering withthe idea of learning data science or web scraping. 
            How quickly my cute idea to scrape pinterest for recipe ingredients to help people dishes based on what they had 
            on hand, would be quickly outshined by chatgpt anyway... So after leaving with my severance I decided to sign up for...
            wait for it... why yes! bootcamp!! Learning software test automation sounded like a great fit and a good way to 
            make an honest and less stressful living without taking on another round of student debt. So in this bootcamp I learned 
            a bit of java and software testing principals and did end up landing a position in QA, which I'm incredibly grateful 
            for, and I continue to learn in. So as I continue to ride the waves of this new direction, the idea for this blog is 
            to share some of the things I learn and how I learn it as a semi-self taught career-changer. There are so. so.
            so many great resources out there to learn test automation, software development, networking, Cloud, Linux, you name it, and 
            I continue to use any and all of those resources I can get my hands on. Most of the things that are sticking for me though, are after
            getting my hands on real applications, and solving contextual problems that demo sites and exercises teaching theory just don't 
            present on their own. So, these words I will write here are to be a bit of facts and information that could be helpful to even one person, 
            and a bit of my feelings on my road to learning, as someone who 3 years ago couldn't have guessed the difference between a native 
            and web app, thought 'git' was a way to tell someone to move over in a southern accent, knew nothing about trying to shine 
            in a sea of applicants, and is still learning about all of this and more.
